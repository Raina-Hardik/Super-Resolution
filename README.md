## Step 0: Setting Up Virtual Environment and Installing Dependencies

Before you start working on the project, follow these steps to set up your virtual environment and install the necessary dependencies.

1. **Create Virtual Environment:**
   Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to create a virtual environment named `venv`:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

2. **Activate Virtual Environment:**
   Activate the virtual environment. The command varies based on your operating system:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On Unix or MacOS:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   After activating the virtual environment, install the project dependencies using the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
